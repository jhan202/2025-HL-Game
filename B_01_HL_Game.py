*** Instructions ***

To begin choose the number of rounds and either customise
the game parameters o go with the default game ( where the 
secret number will be between 1 and 100).

Then choose how many rounds you'd like to play <enter> for
the infinite mode.

Your goal is to try to guess the secret number without 
running out of guesses



Good Luck!
